# README

This repository contains the code I wrote working on my Master's Thesis. As the project involves confidential information, a lot of Jupyter Notebooks are not included here; they contained confidential information. Also, the version history is gone for the same reason. The remainder is used to serve neat hyperlinks in the thesis pdf, so that readers may easily refer to the relevant code.

Much of the code, especially in the notebooks, is prototype-level. Although I strived to document as much of it as I could, much of the one-off code is just left as is. Some challenges may occur when you read through it.

The utils directory contains all the scripts, and the main directory (excluding utils) contains all the notebooks.

This code relies on my custom toolbox tbtools. It doesn't contain confidential information, but is not ready for real sharing yet: Readers of the thesis should refer to the enclosed .zip for the tbtools code.
